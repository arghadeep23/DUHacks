# Plant Classification and Medicinal uses Identification 

## Overview

This model is being designed to analyze input images of plant leaves, specifically with a shape of 256x256x3, and provide information about the plant species, the health status of the leaf (healthy or diseased), and the potential medicinal uses of the identified plant.

## Features to be implemented

1. **Plant Classification:**
   - Given an input image, the tool employs a trained machine learning model to classify the plant species.
   - The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of plant leaves to ensure accurate identification.

2. **Health Status Detection:**
   - The tool can determine whether the leaf is healthy or diseased.
   - This information is crucial for assessing the suitability of the leaf for medicinal purposes.

3. **Medicinal Identification:**
   - If the leaf is identified as belonging to a plant with known medicinal properties, the tool provides information about the medicinal uses of that plant.
   - A comprehensive database of medicinal plants and their uses is integrated into the tool for accurate identification.

## Dataset

We have created 2 classes for each plant leaf, i.e., diseased and healthy for health status detection.
